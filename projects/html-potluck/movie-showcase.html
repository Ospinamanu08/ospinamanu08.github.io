        <h3>SYPNOSIS</h3>
        <p>
            Theodore is a lonely man in 
            the final stages of his divorce. 
            When he's not working as a letter 
            writer, his down time is spent playing 
            video games and occasionally hanging out 
            with friends. He decides to purchase the new OS1,
            which is advertised as the world's first artificially 
            intelligent operating system, 
            "It's not just an operating system, 
            it's a consciousness," the ad states. 
            Theodore quickly finds himself drawn in with Samantha, 
            the voice behind his OS1. As they start spending 
            time together they grow closer and closer 
            and eventually find themselves in love. 
            Having fallen in love with his OS, 
            Theodore finds himself dealing with feelings 
            of both great joy and doubt. 
            As an OS, Samantha has powerful intelligence 
            that she uses to help Theodore in ways others hadn't, 
            but how does she help him deal with his inner conflict of 
            being in love with an OS?

            Liz Gilbert (Roberts) had everything a modern woman is 
            supposed to dream of having a husband, a house, 
            a successful career yet like so many others, 
            she felt lost, confused,

            In her travels, she discovers the true pleasure of 
            nourishment by eating 
            in Italy; the power of prayer in India; 
            and, finally and unexpectedly, 
            the inner peace and balance of true love in Bali.
