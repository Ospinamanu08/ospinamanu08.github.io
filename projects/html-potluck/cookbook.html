        <h1>INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
        <h3>THE GROUND BEEF</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the olive oil. 
                Once hot, add the ground beef and use a wooden spoon or 
                spatula to break it up into small crumbles as it cooks.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook the beef until no longer pink and lightly browned, 
                continuing to break it up so the pieces stay small and even.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sprinkle in the onion powder, black pepper, 
                salt, coriander, smoked paprika, 
                cumin, garlic powder, oregano, chili powder, and cornstarch. 
                Stir well so the spices evenly coat the beef.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the tomato sauce and beef broth, stirring to combine. 
                Let the mixture simmer for a few minutes,
                stirring occasionally, 
                until the beef is juicy, saucy, and slightly thickened.
            </li>
            <h3>Assembly</h3>
            <li>
                Carefully open each small bag of chips, leaving the chips whole.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spoon the warm ground beef directly into each bag.
            </li>
            <li>
                Top with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, pickled jalapeños, 
                chopped red or green onion, cilantro, sour cream, hot sauce, 
                and avocado or guacamole. Feel free to pick whatever toppings 
                you like and enjoy immediately!

        <p>
            If you want something that tastes like straight chocolate bliss, 
            these mousse cups are it. Theyre creamy, velvety, and so satisfying 
            without ever feeling heavy. I love how effortless they are while 
            still feeling like a restaurant-level dessert.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Crushed cookies and melted butter come together 
                    to make the quickest, tastiest base. 
                    It adds just the right amount of crunch 
                    to balance the silky mousse.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heavy cream, butter, sugar, chopped chocolate, 
                    egg yolks, espresso powder, vanilla, and a pinch of salt
                    plus chilled heavy cream for whipping. 
                    It creates that airy, silky texture that melts in your mouth
                    Another option which is the French technique is to use 
                    whipped egg whites for aerating the pudding if 
                    you prefer a lighter version.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fresh heavy cream whipped with powdered sugar and vanilla 
                    extract until soft and fluffy. Its the final touch 
                    that makes each spoonful extra dreamy. 
                    It also helps to cut from the chocolate. If you want 
                    to make this recipe even easier and quicker,use store bought 
                    whipped cream for the topping or skip it 
                    entirely for pure chocolate bliss.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h2>How to make it</h2>
        <h3>Make the crust</h3>
        <p>
            Pulse your oreo cookies in a food processor until they 
            turn into very fine crumbs the texture should look like sand. 
            Transfer to a bowl and mix with melted butter until 
            fully combined and resembling wet sand. Cover and set 
            aside until assembly.
        </p>
        <h3>Make the chocolate mousse</h3>
        <p>
            Place the chopped chocolate in a heat-safe bowl. 
            In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, 
            warm the heavy cream with the butter and sugar until hot 
            and the sugar dissolves. 
            Pour this mixture over the chocolate, cover the bowl,
            and let it sit untouched for about 10 minutes.
            Once melted through, whisk until smooth and glossy, 
            then let it cool slightly. Whisk in the egg yolks, 
            then add the espresso powder, vanilla extract, 
            and a tiny pinch of salt. In a separate bowl, 
            whip the chilled heavy cream to soft peaks and gently 
            fold it into the chocolate mixture until the mousse 
            becomes airy and light. Cover, pop in the fridge, and set aside.
        </p>
        <h3>Make the chantilly cream</h3>
        <p>
            Whip heavy cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla until soft, 
            pillowy peaks form. Cover and set aside. 
            You can spoon it on or pipe it for a bakery-style finish.

            Imagine your favorite chicken Alfredo pasta 
            but transformed into a creamy, dreamy 
            soup youll want to curl up with. Its rich, cheesy, 
            and full of those cozy vibes we all crave once the 
            weather cools down. The best part? It comes together 
            in one pot with simple, everyday ingredients.
        </p>

        <h1>INGREDIENTS</h1>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Were using boneless, s
                    kinless chicken breasts they cook quickly 
                    and stay juicy once chopped. 
                    Toss them in olive oil, Italian seasoning, 
                    lemon pepper, smoked paprika, garlic powder, 
                    salt, and black pepper for flavor that seeps 
                    into every bite.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This is where the magic happens that rich, silky texture 
                    that makes every bite so cozy. Youll melt butter and sauté 
                    garlic until fragrant, then pour in your chicken broth.
                    Then for creaminess, you can use half and half, heavy cream, 
                    or milk  its totally up to you.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Instead of boiling them separately, break up lasagna 
                    sheets into smaller pieces (they dont need to be perfect!) 
                    and let them cook right in the soup. Theyll soak up all 
                    that creamy flavor and turn perfectly silky 
                    in about 12 to 14 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A mix of parmesan and mozzarella gives that signature 
                    Alfredo creaminess, while fresh basil and parsley brighten 
                    everything up. I always say dont skip the fresh herbs 
                    they balance the richness perfectly.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h1>HOW TO MAKE IT</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Whisk together olive oil and your seasonings, 
                then toss the chicken until evenly coated. 
                Sear in a large pot until golden brown on both 
                sides and cooked through, about 5 to 6 minutes per side. 
                Let it cool slightly before chopping into bite-sized chunks. 
            </li>
            <li>
                In the same pot, melt butter and sauté minced garlic for 
                about a minute until it smells incredible. 
                Pour in your broth and choice of milk, half and half, 
                or cream. Add Italian herbs, oregano, salt, black pepper, 
                nutmeg, dried mustard, and cayenne. Let everything come 
                to a gentle simmer over low-medium heat so the flavors infuse.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drop in the broken lasagna sheets and stir occasionally 
                so they dont stick together. Let them cook for about 12 
                to 14 minutes until tender and silky.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the cooked (or rotisserie) chicken back to the pot along 
                with parmesan, mozzarella, parsley, and basil. 
                Stir until the cheeses melt and the soup 
                turns creamy and velvety. 
                Taste and adjust salt or pepper as needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you like it extra creamy, ladle out about 
                1 cup of the soup into a bowl, whisk in a spoonful of flour, 
                and stir it back in until slightly thickened.
            </li>
