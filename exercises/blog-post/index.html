                The F1 Bahrain Testing Day 2 action continued 
                on Thursday morning, with Ferraris Charles Leclerc 
                setting the pace during the second day of the
                first official pre-season test of the 2026 Formula 1 season.

                Under clear skies at the Bahrain International Circuit, 
                teams continued to gather vital data under the all-new 2026 
                regulations. But it was Leclerc who emerged quickest in the 
                morning running, laying down an early marker for Ferrari.

                Leclerc clocked a fastest time of 1:34.273, finishing 
                comfortably clear at the top of the timesheets. 
                McLarens Lando Norris was second, 0.511 seconds adrift, 
                after completing the highest lap tally of the session 
                with 64 tours — two more than both Leclerc 
                and Williams Alex Albon.
