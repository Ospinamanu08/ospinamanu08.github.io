        <h1> Another dimension</h1>
        <p>
            The horizon has vanished. 
            You are no longer in the 
            world you knew, but in a 
            dimension between thoughts. 
            Every step here reshapes reality. 
            Tread carefully, for the path to Victory 
            looks different from the other side
        </p>
