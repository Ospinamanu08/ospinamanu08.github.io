        <h1> The Awakening</h1>
        <p>
            ou open your eyes and find yourself in a dark, 
            cold laboratory. A computer screen nearby is blinking 
            with a red warning: <b>SYSTEM FAILURE IMMINENT</b>. 
            You don't remember how you got here, but the smell 
            of smoke tells you that you need to leave immediately.
        </p>
